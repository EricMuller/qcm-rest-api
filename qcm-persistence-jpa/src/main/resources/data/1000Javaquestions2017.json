    "question": "Why constructors cannot be final, static, or abstract in Java?",
    "response": "If we set a method as final it means we do not want any class to\noverride it. But the constructor (as per Java Language\nSpecification) cannot be overridden. So there is no use of marking it\nfinal.\n \nIf we set a method as abstract it means that it has no body and it\nshould be implemented in a child class. But the constructor is called\nimplicitly when the new keyword is used. Therefore it needs a\nbody.\n \nIf we set a method as static it means that it belongs to the class, but\nnot a particular object. The constructor is always called to initialize\nan object. Therefore, there is no use of marking constructor static.Inheritance"

    "response": "Multiple Inheritance means that a class can inherit behavior from\ntwo or more parent classes.\n \nThe issue with Multiple Inheritance is that both the parent classes\nmay have different implementation for the same method. So they\nhave different ways of doing the same thing. Now which\nimplementation should the child class choose?\n \nThis leads to ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance. This is the main\nreason for Java not supporting Multiple Inheritance in\nimplementation.\n \nLets say you have a class TV and another class AtomBomb. Both\nhave method switchOn() but only TV has switchOff() method. If\nyour class inherits from both these classes then you have an issue\nthat you can switchOn() both parents, but switchOff will only\nswitchOff() TV.\n \nBut you can implement multiple interfaces in Java."

The precise relationship between\nthe expected maximum size and the number of buckets is\nunspecified.\n \nIf the number of key-value mappings exceeds the expected maximum\nsize, the number of buckets is increased.\n \nIncreasing the number of buckets is also known as rehashing.\nRehashing may be fairly expensive. So it is better to create identity\nhash maps with a sufficiently large expected maximum size.\n \nBut iteration over a Map collection requires time proportional to\nthe number of buckets in the hash table. So iteration may take extra\ntime due to large number of buckets.\n \nTherefore the value of expectedMaxSize should be set in\nconsideration with both of these aspects."

If another String with the\nsame value is created (e.g., String s2 = \" Temporary \"), it will\nreference the same object in the String pool.\n \nBut, when you use String s = new String(\"Temporary \"), Java\ncreates a String with the value “Temporary” in the String pool.\nAlso, that String object is then passed to the constructor of the\nString Object i.e. new String(\"Temporary \").

    "response": "If we suspect that our application is stuck due to a Deadlock, then\nwe just take a thread dump by using the command specific to\nenvironment in which your application is running. Eg. In Linux you\ncan use command kill -3.\n \nIn case of deadlock, you will see in thread dump the current status\nand stack trace of threads in the JVM, and one or more of them will\nbe stuck with message deadlock.\n \nAlso you can do this programmatically by using the ThreadMXBean\nclass that ships with the JDK.\n \nIf you don't need programmatic detection you can do this via\nJConsole. On the thread tab there is a \"detect deadlock\" button.\n Mixed Questions"

But the main difference is that in State pattern internal\nstate of an Object is one of the determining factors for selecting the\nStrategy for change of state.\n \nWhere as in Strategy pattern, client can pass some external\nparameter in input during method invocation that determines the\nstrategy to be used at run time.\n \nTherefore State pattern is based on the Object’s internal state,\nwhere as Strategy pattern is based on Client’s invocation.\n \nState pattern is very useful in increasing the maintainability of the\ncode in a large code-base."

If you want to represent data in a Tree data\nstructure, Composite pattern can be used.\n \nE.g. In an Organization, to a Manager has Employees. But Manager\nis also an Employee. If we start from CEO level, there is one big\ntree for the whole organization structure. Under that big tree there\nare many sub-trees. This can be easily represented with Composite\ndesign pattern.\n \nRecursion: Another use of Composite design pattern is Recursion. If\nwe have a Recursion based algorithm, we need data to be passed to\nalgorithm in a data structure that treats individual objects and\ncompositions at each level of recursion uniformly.\nE.g.  To implement a recursive Polynomial Solving algorithm, we\ncan use Composite design pattern to store the intermediate results.\n \nGraphics: Another good use of Composite design pattern is in\nGraphics.

Double Checked Locking: This is the most popular method\nto implement Singleton in Java. It is based on Lazy\nInitialization. In this we first check the criteria for locking\nbefore acquiring a lock to create an object. In Java we use\nit with volatile keyword.\n \nSample code:\n \nclass DoubleCheckSingleton {\n    private volatile HelloSingleton helloSingleton; // Use Volatile\n \n    public HelloSingleton getHelloSingleton() {\n        HelloSingleton result = helloSingleton;\n        if (result == null) {\n            synchronized(this) { // Synchronize for thread safety\n                result = helloSingleton;\n                if (result == null) {\n    result = new HelloSingleton();\n                    helloSingleton = result;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n \n}\n 2. Bill Pugh Singleton: We can also use the method by Bill\nPugh for implementing Singleton in Java.

Only when getInstance() method is\ncalled, InnerSingleton class is loaded and an Instance is created.\n \n3. Enum: We can also use Java enum to create thread-safe\nimplementation.

It is generally used in Remote Method\nInvocation (RMI) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC). It is\nalso known as a Stub.\n \n3. Protective Proxy: This is an object that control the access\nto a Master object. It can authenticate and authorize the\nclient for accessing the Master object. If client has right\npermissions, it allows client to access the main object.\n \n4. Smart Proxy: It is an object that can add additional\ninformation to the main object. It can track the number of\nother objects accessing the main object. It can track the\ndifferent clients from where request is coming. It can even\ndeny access to an object if the number of requests is\ngreater than a threshold"

    "response": "Adapter pattern provides a different interface to an object. But the\nProxy always provides same interface to the object.\n \nAdapter is like providing an interface suitable to client’s use. But\nProxy is same interface that has additional feature or check.\n \nE.g. In electrical appliances we use Adapter to convert from one\ntype of socket to another type of socket. In case of proxy, we have a\nplug with built-in surge protector. The interface for plug and the\noriginal device remains same."

We can\ncreate an implementation and store it in the interface, which is an\nabstraction. Where as specific implementation of other features can\nbe done in concrete classes that implement the interface.\n \nOften Bridge design pattern is implemented by using Adapter\npattern.\n \nE.g. we have Shape interface. We want to make Square and Circle\nshapes. But further we want to make RedSquare, BlackSquare\nshapes and GreenCircle, WhiteCircle shapes. In this case rather\nthan creating one hierarchy of all the shapes, we separate the Color\nconcern from Shape hierarchy.\n \nSo we create two hierarchies. One is Shape to Square and Shape to\nCircle hierarchy. Another one is Color to Red, Black, Green, White\nhierarchy. In this way we can create multiple types of shapes with\nmultiple colors with Bridge design pattern."

It needs to just work with the given interface. Rest of\nthe implementation can be changed and configured for different\nfeatures.\n \nDependency injection is also used to export a system's configuration\ndetails into configuration files. So we can configure same\napplication run in different environments based on configuration.\nE.g. Run in Test environment, UAT environment, and Production\nenvironment.\n \nDependency Injection (DI) applications provide more ease and\nflexibility of testing. These can be tested in isolation in Unit Test.\n \nDependency injection (DI) isolates client from the impact of design\nand implementation changes.

If the name of a bean is same as the name of\nbean referred in autowire byname, then it automatically wires it.\n \nE.g. In following example, Manager bean is wired to Employee\nbean by Name.\n \n<bean id=\"employee\" class=\"com.dept.Employee\"\nautowire=\"byName\" />\n<bean id=\"manager\" class=\"com.dept.Manager\" />\n \n \nbyType: In this case, Spring container check the properties of beans\nreferred with attribute byType. Then it matches the type of bean and\nwires. If it finds more than one such bean of that type, it throws a\nfatal exception.\n \nE.g. In following example, Manager bean is wired by type toEmployee bean.\n \n<bean id=\"employee\" class=\"com.dept.Employee\"\nautowire=\"byType\" />\n<bean id=\"manager\" class=\"com.dept.Manager\" />\n \nconstructor: In this case, Spring container looks for byType attribute\nin constructor argument. It tries to find the bean with exact name. If\nit finds more than one bean of same name, it throws fatal exception.\nThis case is similar to byType case.\n \nE.g. In following example “constructor” mode is used for\nautowiring.\n<bean id=\"employee\" class=\"com.dept.Employee\"\nautowire=\"constructor\" />\n<bean id=\"manager\" class=\"com.dept.Manager\" />\n \nautodetect: This is an advanced mode for autowiring. In this case,\nby default Spring tries to find a constructor match. If it does not find\nconstructor then it uses autowire by Type.\n \nE.g.

So we let the\ntransactions do their work without locking the resources initially.\n \nJust before the commit, we check if any of the resource has changed\nby another transaction, then we throw exception and rollback the\ntransaction.\n \nPessimistic: In Pessimistic locking we assume that concurrent\ntransactions will conflict while working with same resources. So a\ntransaction has to first obtain lock on the resources it wants to\nupdate.\n \nThe other transaction can proceed with same resource only after the\nlock has been released by previous transaction."

    "response": "Version number is used in optimistic locking in Hibernate. When a\ntransaction modifies an object, it increments its version. Based on\nversion number, second transaction can determine if the object it has\nread earlier has changed or not.\n \nIf the version number at the time of write is different than the\nversion number at the time of read, then we should not commit the\ntransaction."

    "response": "Hibernate supports following inheritance mapping strategies\nbetween classes and tables:\n \nTable per class hierarchy: In case of multiple types of books, we\ncan have one book class and one book table. We can store all child\nclasses of book like- HardCoverBook, PaperBackBook etc in same\ntable book. But we can identify the subclasses by a BookType\ncolumn in Book table.\n \nTable per subclass: In this case we can have separate table for each\nkind of book. HardCoverBook table for HardCoverBook book\nclass. PaperBackBook table for PaperBackBook book class. And\nthere will be a parent table, Book for Book class.\n \nTable per concrete class: In this case also we have separate table\nfor each kind of book. But in this case we have even inherited\nproperties defined inside each table. There is no parent table Book\nfor Book class, since it is not a concrete class.\n \n Maven"

If you need high bandwidth, you can scale up\nyour cloud capacity. When you do not need high bandwidth, you can just scale\ndown. There is no need to be tied into an inflexible fixed capacity\ninfrastructure.\nDisaster Recovery: Cloud Computing provides robust backup and recovery\nsolutions that are hosted in cloud. Due to this there is no need to spend extra\nresources on homegrown disaster recovery. It also saves time in setting up\ndisaster recovery.\nAutomatic Software Updates: Most of the Cloud providers give automatic\nsoftware updates. This reduces the extra task of installing new software\nversion and always catching up with the latest software installs.\nLow Capital Expenditure: In Cloud computing the model is Pay as you Go.\nThis means there is very less upfront capital expenditure. There is a variable\npayment that is based on the usage.\nCollaboration: In a cloud environment, applications can be shared between\nteams. This increases collaboration and communication among team members.\nRemote Work: Cloud solutions provide flexibility of working remotely. There\nis no on site work. One can just connect from anywhere and start working.Security: Cloud computing solutions are more secure than regular onsite work.\nData stored in local servers and computers is prone to security attacks. In\nCloud Computing, there are very few loose ends. Cloud providers give a\nsecure working environment to its users.\nDocument Control: Once the documents are stored in a common repository, it\nincreases the visibility and transparency among companies and their clients.\nSince there is one shared copy, there are fewer chances of discrepancies.\nCompetitive Pricing: In Cloud computing there are multiple players, so they\nkeep competing among themselves and provide very good pricing. This comes\nout much cheaper compared to other options.\nEnvironment Friendly: Cloud computing saves precious environmental\nresources also. By not blocking the resources and bandwidth."

    "response": "Scalability is the ability of a system to handle the increased load on its current\nhardware and software resources. In a highly scalable system it is possible to\nincrease the workload without increasing the resource capacity.  Scalability\nsupports any sudden surge in the demand/traffic with current set of resources.\n \nElasticity is the ability of a system to increase the workload by increasing the\nhardware/software resources dynamically. Highly elastic systems can handle\nthe increased demand and traffic by dynamically commission and\ndecommission resources. Elasticity is an important characteristic of Cloud\nComputing applications. Elasticity means how well your architecture is\nadaptable to workload in real time.\n \n \nE.g. If in a system, one server can handle 100 users, 2 servers can handle 200\nusers and 10 servers can handle 1000 users. But in case for adding every X\nusers, if you need 2X the amount of servers, then it is not a scalable design.\n \nLet say, you have just one user login every hour on your site. Your one server\ncan handle this load. But, if suddenly, 1000 users login at once, can your\nsystem quickly start new web servers on the fly to handle this load? Your\ndesign is elastic if it can handle such sudden increase in traffic so quickly."
